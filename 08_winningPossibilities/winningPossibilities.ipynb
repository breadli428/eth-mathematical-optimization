Of course he's hoping for another German championship - and if you ask him, there is still hope in this season: His team currently has 21 points with 10 matchdays remaining (on every matchday, every team plays precisely one match), so \"TBV Lemgo\" could end up with 41 points, which is more than the current leaders \"Rhein-Neckar Löwen\" and \"Füchse Berlin\" have now.
